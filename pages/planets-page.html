                    The doomed planet WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter that orbits so
                    close to its parent star, it's being torn apart. It takes
                    this alien world only 1.1 days to completely circle its sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The star's scorching heat is slowly stripping away and
                    devouring the planet's atmosphere. In 10 million years, this
                    alien world could be completely consumed. Almost two times
                    the size of our Jupiter, WASP-12b is a sizzling gas giant
                    whose temperature is approximately 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit
                    (2,210 degrees Celsius).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gravity causes enormous tidal forces which are streching the
                    planet into the shape of an egg. A hulking monster of a star
                    is stealing pieces of its nearby planet, WASP-12b, to
                    assemble itself into the ultimate Frankenstein creation. The
                    extreme gravity is stretching the hot gas giant into the
                    shape of an egg, all the while slowly cannibalizing the
                    planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Relatively soon (10 million years; a fleeting moment in
                    space time) this planet will be completely devoured by its
                    hungry star. If you enjoy watching the world fall to pieces,
                    then this planet is for you.

                    Kepler-36b and its companion planet, Kepler-36c, are far too
                    close to their sun to be in the habitable zone, but they are
                    bizarrely close to each other. On their closest approach,
                    they come within about 1.2 million miles (1.9 million
                    kilometers) of each other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite being in a similar orbital distance from their star,
                    the pair are very different. Kepler-36b, is a super-Earth
                    that orbits a G-type star 1,533 light-years from Earth in
                    13.9 days. Its mass is about four times greater than
                    Earth's.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Its companion planet, Kepler-36c is Neptune-sized with a
                    mass more than seven times Earth's; it takes 16.2 days to
                    complete one orbit of the star, which is older and hotter
                    than our Sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The two planets have repeated close encounters, experiencing
                    a conjunction every 97 days on average. At that time, they
                    are separated by less than five Earth-moon distances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such close approaches stir up tremendous gravitational tides
                    that squeeze and stretch both planets, which may promote
                    active volcanism on Kepler-36b.

                    This far-off blue planet may look like a friendly haven, but
                    don't be deceived! Weather here is deadly. The planet's
                    cobalt blue color comes from a hazy, blow-torched atmosphere
                    containing clouds laced with glass. Howling winds send the
                    storming glass sideways at 5,400 mph (2km/s), whipping all
                    in a sickening spiral.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's death by a million cuts on this slasher planet! HD
                    189733 b is a gas giant exoplanet that orbits a K-type star.
                    Its mass is 1.13 Jupiter's, it takes 2.2 days to complete
                    one orbit of its star, and is 0.0313 AU from its star. Its
                    discovery was announced in 2005.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If seen directly, this planet would look like a deep blue
                    dot, reminiscent of Earth's color as seen from space. That
                    is where the comparison ends. On this turbulent alien world,
                    the daytime temperature is nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
                    and it possibly rains glass sideways in howling, 4,500-mph
                    winds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cobalt blue color comes not from the reflection of a
                    tropical ocean as it does on Earth, but rather a hazy,
                    blow-torched atmosphere containing high clouds laced with
                    silicate particles. Silicates condensing in the heat could
                    form very small drops of glass that scatter blue light more
                    than red light.

                    The heat of KELT-9b is too much even for molecules to remain
                    intact. Molecules of hydrogen gas are likely ripped apart on
                    the dayside of tidally-locked KELT-9b, unable to re-form
                    until their disjointed atoms flow around to the planet's
                    nightside.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a dayside temperature of more than 7,800 degrees
                    Fahrenheit (4,600 Kelvin), KELT-9b is a planet that is
                    hotter than most stars. But its star, called KELT-9, is even
                    hotter; a blue A-type star that is likely unraveling the
                    planet through evaporation. KELT-9b is a gas giant 2.8 times
                    more massive than Jupiter, but only half as dense.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists would expect the planet to have a smaller radius,
                    but the extreme radiation from its host star has caused the
                    planet's atmosphere to puff up like a balloon. The planet is
                    also unusual in that it orbits perpendicular to the spin
                    axis of the star. That would be analogous to the planet
                    orbiting perpendicular to the plane of our solar system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One "year" on this planet is less than two days long. With
                    each orbit, KELT-9 b twice experiences the full range of
                    stellar temperatures, producing what amounts to a peculiar
                    seasonal sequence. The planet experiences “summer” when it
                    swings over each hot pole and “winter” when it passes over
                    the star's cooler midsection. So KELT-9 b experiences two
                    summers and two winters every orbit, with each season about
                    nine hours.
