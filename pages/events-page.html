                    A number of dogs have gone into space under the former
                    Soviet Union. The most well-known was Laika in 1957. She was
                    picked up off the streets as a stray mongrel puppy in Moscow
                    and deemed suitable because of her gentle temperament.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists also believed a stray would be better at
                    coping with adverse conditions. Though other dogs had been
                    launched into space before her, Laika is famous for being
                    the first animal to orbit the Earth. However, she was never
                    to return.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She was sent off with just one meal and a seven-day oxygen
                    supply. Overheated, cramped, frightened, and probably
                    hungry, the space dog gave her life for her country,
                    involuntarily fulfilling a canine suicide mission. The
                    Soviet government claimed she survived for seven days. The
                    reality: Laika overheated and died just five hours into the
                    flight.

                    For about 21 hours while in orbit he heard a noise coming
                    from the outside, an irregular pulse against his door, just
                    as if someone was knocking: Knock knock - who's there? "It
                    didn't come from outside or from inside the spaceship, but
                    it seemed that someone was knocking on the lining of the
                    spaceship as you could beat an iron bucket with a wooden
                    hammer".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He tried to see something out of the ordinary, but found
                    nothing, the man immediately communicated the thing to the
                    base, from which the answers did not arrive ...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No one was in fact ready for such an eventuality, so much so
                    that they could not even find a rational explanation
                    incident. Once back on Earth, the astronaut together with
                    his team, analyzed the possible causes, but nothing was able
                    to explain the anomaly, so that after almost 20 years it
                    continues to be one of the strangest cases reported by space
                    missions.

                    The sun is burning all the time. However, there are times
                    when the Sun might get a bit bright. And this sudden burst
                    of brightness is known as "Solar Flare". But most of the
                    time a solar flare will be accompanied by another phenomenon
                    known as "Coronal Mass Ejection".

                    They can go in any direction. Matter of fact, there are
                    times when the particles and radio-waves from the solar
                    flare might come towards the Earth as well. In those cases,
                    we will face various issues on Earth. Interestingly, such a
                    strong solar storm almost hit the Earth on 23rd July 2012.
                    This was a potentially damaging solar flare. Lucky for us,
                    we have barely escaped from it.

                    According to astronomers, all the galaxies, stars, planets,
                    etc. we have discovered as of yet just comprise about 4% of
                    the entire universe. The rest of the 96% is made of unknown
                    stuff. We haven't yet detected, seen, or even grasped the
                    idea of the unknown universe. As a result, astronomers call
                    them "Dark Energy" and "Dark Matter".

                  <p>
                    Still, we know a lot. In fact, the observable universe is
                    known to contain around 2 trillion galaxies and 1 billion
                    trillions of stars. By contrast, there are more stars in the
                    observable universe than there are grains of sand on our
                    planet. Let that sink in for a moment!
