                    The Fermi Paradox refers to the dichotomy between the high
                    probability that extraterrestrial intelligence exists and
                    the fact that we have no evidence for such aliens. This
                    paradox was described by the late British science-fiction
                    author, Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who said: "Two possibilities
                    exist: Either we are alone in the universe or we are not.
                    Both are equally terrifying."

                  <p>
                    Many experts since have grappled with the same question.
                    Why, considering the multitude of planets and stars in the
                    Milky Way, have we not heard from anyone?We call this
                    problem the Fermi Paradox, and there are a number of
                    possible solutions — some more unnerving than others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Fermi Paradox is a problem that asks, where are all the
                    aliens(opens in new tab) in the universe? If life is so
                    abundant, why haven't we been visited by, or heard from,
                    anyone else? According to NASA(opens in new tab), in just
                    the last two decades we have found more than 4,000 planets
                    beyond our solar system, with trillions of stars thought to
                    exist in our galaxy — most of which host their own planets.

                    Considering life sprang up on Earth, would we not have
                    expected it to start in at least one other location in the
                    last 14 billion years of the universe?

                    The Drake equation is an idea, proposed by the American
                    astronomer Frank Drake in 1961, that the number of potential
                    civilizations in the universe can be calculated if we know a
                    few key variables. The formula for the Drake equation is: N
                    = R* x &fnof;p x ne x &fnof;1 x &fnof;i x &fnof;c x L R* =
                    average rate of star formation in Milky Way &fnof;p =
                    fraction of stars supporting planets ne = average number of
                    planets that could potentially support life for each star
                    that hosts planets &fnof;1 = fraction of those planets that
                    "could" support life that actually develop life &fnof;i =
                    fraction of planets that develop intelligent life, and thus
                    intelligent civilizations &fnof;c = fraction of those
                    civilizations that develop a technology to communicate their
                    existence L = length of time over which these civilizations
                    send those detectable signals into space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By including all of these factors in the equation, the idea
                    is you might be able to work out how many other intelligent
                    civilizations exist in the universe. This "simple" formula,
                    Drake once said, would be akin to estimating the number of
                    students at a university by multiplying the number of new
                    students entering each year by the average number of years a
                    student will spend at a university, according to SETI.

                    As of yet, however, a number of key variables in the
                    equation remain unknown, meaning we can't yet come up with a
                    possible number for other species of intelligent life.

                    Simply stated, the Great Filter says that intelligent
                    interstellar lifeforms must first take many critical steps,
                    and at least one of these steps must be highly improbable.
                    Indeed, the premise of the Great Filter is that there's at
                    least one hurdle that is so high virtually no species can
                    clear it and move on to the next.

                    In 1964, Kardashev came up with the idea that the status of
                    a culture, as a whole, depends on two primary things: Energy
                    and technology. He theorized that a civilization's technical
                    advancement runs parallel to the amount of energy that the
                    civilization is able to harness and manipulate. Essentially,
                    the more energy that a society can produce, the more
                    technologically advanced they are (this was originally just
                    tied to energy available for communications, but has since
                    been expanded).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In other words, according to this theory, a culture's
                    development (in the very widest sense) is a product of
                    energy and of technology: Through technology, energy is
                    harnessed, and as social systems are expressions of this
                    technology, the status of a culture rests upon (and is
                    determined by) the amount of energy that is harnessed. The
                    scale has a number of different categories (levels of
                    classification).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In recent years, scientists have expanded this scale to
                    measure hypothetical civilizations—civilizations that are
                    galactic, intergalactic, and even multiverse in nature.
